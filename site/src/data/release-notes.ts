    summary:
      'Clicking Jellyscribe used to reload the whole Jellyfin web app and drop you onto a plugin settings page. It now opens as a proper page inside Jellyfin, the way Jellyfin Enhanced\'s Bookmarks does: no reload, Jellyfin\'s header and menu stay put, and the back button takes you straight back to where you were. You can also bookmark it, since it has its own address ending in #/jellyscribe. On Jellyfin 12, where the sidebar was replaced by a menu under your profile picture, Jellyscribe now appears in that menu, so it is reachable there for the first time. Everything on the page works as before, and the old settings-page address still works.',

If you already use File Transformation, nothing changes for you and you still get exactly one link. The link also now works on servers that run Jellyfin under a sub-path such as /jellyfin, where it used to point at the wrong address.

For a Letterboxd account it said the login would be checked on the first sync, so a wrong password or a mistyped name went unnoticed until something quietly failed to appear on Letterboxd. Verify login now works for Letterboxd too: it signs in the same way syncing will and tells you whether it got in, and if not, the reason Letterboxd gave. It also catches a common mix-up: Letterboxd no longer lets you sign in with your email address, so Jellyscribe now asks for your Letterboxd username instead and explains why if you enter an email.',

    summary:
      'Jellyscribe sends your rating along when it logs a film to your Letterboxd diary, and that happens the moment the credits roll. Most people rate afterwards, and until now those ratings never left Jellyfin: the film was already logged, so later syncs skipped it. Jellyscribe now notices when you change a film\'s rating and, about ten seconds after you settle on a score, sets it as your Letterboxd rating for that film. Jellyfin\'s own web app has no star rating, only favourites, so the usual way in is a review written with Jellyfin Enhanced 12.10 or later with its option to copy review stars into Jellyfin switched on; ratings from any other app that saves them to Jellyfin work too. Only real changes are sent: ratings already in Jellyfin when you update are left alone until you change them, and favouriting or rewatching a film leaves Letterboxd alone. If Letterboxd is briefly unreachable, the rating is retried a few times. As on Letterboxd itself, rating a film marks it watched and takes it off your watchlist. Clearing a rating in Jellyfin does not remove it from Letterboxd, and some apps, Infuse among them, keep ratings to themselves and never save them to Jellyfin, so those still cannot be synced. Each Letterboxd account has a new Sync ratings to Letterboxd switch, on by default.',

If you already track some of that somewhere else, anime on AniList for example, those watches were turning up on Letterboxd or Serializd as well, and the only way to stop it was to switch the whole account off. Each linked account now has an Excluded libraries list in its settings. Tick a library there and nothing from it is sent to that account, whether by the daily catch-up or the moment you finish watching. The setting is per account, so two people sharing a Jellyfin login can make different choices, and a library you leave unticked syncs exactly as before.

A watchlist of a thousand films turned into a playlist of ninety-nine, and the diary import only marked your first hundred watched films as played.

Jellyscribe now asks for each page exactly the way Letterboxd expects, so the whole list comes through, and if Letterboxd ever stops handing over new pages, the sync stops, says so in the log, and leaves your playlist exactly as it was instead of quietly shrinking it.

The label was there, the box was not, and nothing showed up in the browser console to explain it. The cause was on our side: the field was named with the word "cookie" in it, and blockers carry sweeping rules that hide anything named that way in order to kill cookie consent banners. Ours got caught in the net. The field has been renamed internally so blockers leave it alone, and it still reads Raw cookies on screen.

Correcting the password was supposed to clear that and resume on the next run. It did if you edited the account from the user page, but not from the admin dashboard, because those two save through different paths and only one of them reset the pause. Admins were left stuck: the password was right, the badge still said failing, and even deleting the account and adding it again changed nothing, because the paused state is remembered per Letterboxd username and a new account simply inherited it.

It did nothing for requests that were already sitting in Seerr waiting for approval, which for anyone who had been hit by the problem was most of them. The reason is that Jellyscribe skips any title Seerr already has a request for, so those requests were never looked at again and nothing ever approved them.

Everything past the first page simply never arrived. Separately, watchlist titles sent to Seerr were created but never downloaded. Seerr only hands a request to Radarr or Sonarr once it is approved, and it decides that from the permissions of the person the request belongs to, not from the admin API key the plugin uses, so requests for anyone without auto-approve sat in the pending queue forever.

But checking a title watched by hand, using the checkmark rather than actually playing it, could leave Jellyfin\'s own watched-date field set to January 1st 1970 instead of a real date, and the plugin trusted that value as-is.
