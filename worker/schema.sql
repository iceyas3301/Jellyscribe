-- Install-count telemetry (NOT opt-in, unlike pings). Captures the two signals

-- on the Worker) and the release-asset download (Option B, GET /dl/<tag>/... which
-- 302s to GitHub). A unique install is approximated by a SHA-256 of
-- (ip : week : HASH_SALT): weekly-rotating so the same install dedupes WITHIN a
-- week (giving a WAU-style headcount), and someone reading the table without the
-- salt cannot link rows ACROSS weeks. The salt is fixed, so whoever holds it can
-- hash candidate IPs and link a known IP's rows; it is a secret, not a guarantee.
-- The raw IP is never stored. IP-based identity is coarse (NAT undercounts, dynamic IPs
-- overcount), so read these as order-of-magnitude active-install figures, not an
-- exact roster, the opt-in pings.instance_id remains the only exact per-install id.
-- version is '' for manifest polls, the release tag (e.g. v1.18.4) for downloads.
